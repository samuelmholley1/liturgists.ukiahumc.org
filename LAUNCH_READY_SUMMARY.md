## üéØ FINAL STEPS (WHAT YOU NEED TO DO)

### **TODAY (October 25):**
1. **Test yourself** (30 min)
   - Sign up for Nov 3
   - Test cancel feature
   - Test on phone

2. **Soft launch** (2-3 hours)

   - Fix any issues reported

---

## üí° KNOWN ACCEPTABLE LIMITATIONS

### **Won't Fix (Low Priority):**
- **Alert boxes** instead of toast notifications (works fine, simple)
- **Password "lovewins"** is public (acceptable for small congregation)
- **No user accounts** (everyone uses same password - by design)
- **Airtable rate limits** (middleware helps, unlikely to hit with 50 people)

### **Future Enhancements (Post-Launch):**
- Email notifications when someone signs up
- Automatic reminders 1 week before service
- Mobile app (PWA install prompt)
- Admin panel to manage liturgists

---

2. Verify Airtable credentials in `.env.local`
3. Check service worker in DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers
4. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
5. Clear cache if really stuck

### **Emergency Rollback:**
If something breaks badly, revert to previous commit:
