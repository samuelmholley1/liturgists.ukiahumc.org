# üö® PRE-LAUNCH TESTING CHECKLIST - Liturgist App

**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS TESTING BEFORE EMAIL BLAST

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO TEST BEFORE EMAILING

### 1. **VERIFY AIRTABLE INTEGRATION** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Previous Issue:** "signed Linda up for oct 12 but still not updating despite appearing in Airtable"

**Tests:**
```bash
1. Sign up for Oct 27, 2025 (upcoming Sunday)
2. Check Airtable - verify record appears
3. Hard refresh page - does the signup show?
4. Wait 5 seconds - does it auto-refresh and show?
```

**Potential Bug:** The quarterly view generates dates like `2025-10-27`, but Airtable might be storing them differently. Need to verify the `serviceDate` field in Airtable matches EXACTLY what we're generating.

**How to Debug:**
- Open browser console ‚Üí Network tab
- Look at `/api/services` response
- Compare `date` field with Airtable's `Service Date` field
- They MUST match character-for-character

---

### 2. **TEST ALL Q4 2025 SUNDAYS APPEAR**

**Expected Sundays:**
```
October:   6, 13, 20, 27  (4 Sundays)
November:  3, 10, 17, 24  (4 Sundays)  
December:  1, 8, 15, 22, 29 (5 Sundays)
TOTAL: 13 Sundays
```

**Test:** Scroll through the list - verify all 13 are visible

**Potential Bug:** October 6 might not show if quarter generation has off-by-one error.

---

### 3. **TEST CACHING FIXES** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Previous Issue:** "no matter how much I clear cache hard refresh etc, it shows previous versions"

**Tests:**
1. Make a signup
2. Open in incognito/private window - does it show?
3. Open on phone - does it show?
4. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on PC) - does it show?
5. Close browser completely, reopen - does it show?

**What to Check:**
- Open DevTools ‚Üí Application tab ‚Üí Service Workers
- Should see `uumc-liturgist-v2` as active
- Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Disable cache checkbox
- Refresh and verify `Cache-Control: no-store` headers on API calls

---

### 4. **TEST DUPLICATE PREVENTION**

**Tests:**
1. Sign up as Main Liturgist for Oct 27
2. Open in another browser/device/incognito
3. Try to sign up for same service
4. Verify "Main Liturgist" is grayed out with "(Taken by [name])"
5. Verify only "Backup" is selectable
6. Submit as Backup - verify both names show

**Potential Bug:** Race condition if two people click submit at exact same millisecond

---

### 5. **TEST QUARTERLY NAVIGATION**

**Tests:**
1. Default view should show Q4 2025 (Oct-Dec)
2. Click "Next Quarter" ‚Üí Should show Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar)
3. Verify amber warning box appears: "Sign-ups Open in December"
4. Verify all services are grayed out and non-clickable
5. Verify buttons say "Sign-ups Not Open Yet"
6. Click "Previous Quarter" ‚Üí Should go back to Q4 2025
7. Click "Previous Quarter" again ‚Üí Should show Q3 2025 (Jul-Sep)

**Potential Bug:** Q3 2025 is in the past - will it show services? Or just empty? Does it break?

---

### 6. **TEST MOBILE EXPERIENCE** üì±

**Critical Tests:**
1. Open on iPhone/Android (actual device, not simulator)
2. Password entry works? (doesn't auto-capitalize?)
3. Calendar widget doesn't block content?
4. Modal scrolls properly?
5. Touch targets are big enough? (buttons at least 44x44px)
6. Landscape orientation works?
7. Zoom in/out works?
8. Can type in text fields without keyboard covering them?

---

### 7. **TEST PASSWORD BEHAVIOR**

**Tests:**
1. Close all browser windows/tabs
2. Reopen liturgists.ukiahumc.org
3. Should show password screen
4. Enter wrong password ‚Üí Should reject with error
5. Enter "lovewins" ‚Üí Should enter successfully
6. Refresh page ‚Üí Should stay logged in (sessionStorage)
7. Open in new tab ‚Üí Should also be logged in
8. Close browser, reopen ‚Üí Should ask for password again

---

### 8. **TEST EDGE CASES**

**Tests:**
1. **Long names:** Sign up as "Christopher Alexander Montgomery III" - does it display properly?
2. **Invalid email:** Try entering "notanemail" - does it accept it? (it will - no validation!)
3. **Empty phone:** Leave phone blank - does it work?
4. **Special characters:** Sign up as "Jos√© Mar√≠a" or "O'Brien" - works?
5. **Switching selections:** Select "Other", fill in name, then switch back to dropdown person - does it clear?
6. **Both roles filled:** Try to sign up when both Main and Backup are taken - does it block properly?

---

## üêõ KNOWN/LIKELY BUGS

### Bug #1: **Date Matching Between Airtable and Generated Services**
- **Symptom:** Signups appear in Airtable but not on the page
- **Root Cause:** Format mismatch between what we generate (`2025-10-27`) and what Airtable stores
- **Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Test:** Compare Airtable's "Service Date" field format with browser console logs

### Bug #2: **No Email Validation**
- **Symptom:** Can enter "notanemail" as email address
- **Impact:** Invalid emails get stored in Airtable
- **Priority:** üü° MEDIUM
- **Fix Needed:** Add regex validation before submit

### Bug #3: **Race Condition on Signups**
- **Symptom:** Two people might sign up for same role simultaneously
- **Impact:** Airtable would have two records for same role, page only shows one
- **Priority:** üü° MEDIUM
- **Test:** Use two devices, both click "Sign Up" at same exact moment

### Bug #4: **Service Worker Might Cache Old Version**
- **Symptom:** After code deploy, users see old version
- **Our Fix:** Changed cache name to v2, added `skipWaiting()`, network-first for HTML/API
- **Priority:** üü° MEDIUM
- **Test:** Deploy new version, check if users auto-update

### Bug #5: **No Confirmation After Signup**
- **Symptom:** User clicks submit, modal closes, no feedback
- **Impact:** User doesn't know if it worked
- **Priority:** üü° MEDIUM
- **Fix Needed:** Add success message/toast

### Bug #6: **Quarter Boundary Issues**
- **Symptom:** On Jan 1, 2026, what quarter shows? Q4 2025 or Q1 2026?
- **Impact:** Confusion, might show wrong data
- **Priority:** üü¢ LOW (not until Jan 1)
- **Test:** Change system date to Dec 31, 2025 / Jan 1, 2026

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING FEATURES

### Critical (needed before launch):
- ‚ùå **No way to cancel/delete a signup** - If someone makes a mistake, they can't fix it
- ‚ùå **No email validation** - Could accept "notanemail" as valid
- ‚ùå **No confirmation message** - User doesn't know if signup succeeded
- ‚ùå **No error message if signup fails** - Silent failure

### Important (nice to have):
- ‚ùå No way to edit contact info after signup
- ‚ùå No email confirmation sent to user
- ‚ùå No admin dashboard to see all signups at once
- ‚ùå No ability to add notes (e.g., "I'll be 10 minutes late")
- ‚ùå No print-friendly view for printing schedules

### Enhancement (future):
- ‚ùå No calendar export (iCal/Google Calendar)
- ‚ùå No SMS reminders before service
- ‚ùå No "contact liturgist" button to email them
- ‚ùå No swap functionality (trade dates with someone)
- ‚ùå No history view (see what dates I served in past)

---

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED PRE-LAUNCH ACTIONS

### Action 1: **Test the Complete Flow RIGHT NOW** ‚ö°
```
1. Visit liturgists.ukiahumc.org
2. Enter password: lovewins
3. Verify all 13 Q4 Sundays appear
4. Sign up for next Sunday (Oct 27) as Main Liturgist
5. Open Airtable - verify record is there with correct date format
6. Hard refresh page (Cmd+Shift+R) - does signup show?
7. Wait 10 seconds - does it auto-refresh?
8. Open on phone - does it show there too?
9. In another browser, try to sign up for same role - is it blocked/grayed out?
10. Sign up as Backup - does it allow you?
```

### Action 2: **Add Email Validation** (5 minutes)
Would you like me to add this now? Quick fix:
```typescript
const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
if (!emailRegex.test(signupForm.email)) {
  alert('Please enter a valid email address')
  return
}
```

### Action 3: **Add Success Confirmation** (5 minutes)
Would you like me to add this now? 
```typescript
// After successful signup
alert('‚úÖ Success! You\'re signed up as ' + role + ' for ' + displayDate + 
      '\n\nYou should see your name appear within a few seconds.')
```

### Action 4: **Test on Actual Devices**
**Must test on:**
- [ ] iPhone Safari (actual phone, not simulator)
- [ ] Android Chrome (actual phone)
- [ ] Desktop Chrome
- [ ] Desktop Safari
- [ ] Desktop Firefox

**Why:** Mobile browsers behave differently than desktop, especially with:
- Fixed positioning (calendar widget)
- Keyboard behavior
- Touch targets
- Viewport height calculations

### Action 5: **Verify Airtable Field Names** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
Open your Airtable base and verify these field names match EXACTLY (case-sensitive):
- [ ] `Service Date`
- [ ] `Display Date`
- [ ] `Name`
- [ ] `Email`
- [ ] `Phone`
- [ ] `Role`
- [ ] `Submitted At`

If ANY field name is different, the app will break silently.

Subject: Help Test New Liturgist Signup System

Hi [Name],

I've built a new online signup system for liturgists. Before I send it to 
everyone, could you help me test it?

Website: liturgists.ukiahumc.org
Password: lovewins

Please try:
1. Signing up for a Sunday
2. Checking that your name appears
3. Opening on your phone

Let me know if anything seems broken or confusing. Thanks!

- Sam

**Do you want me to add this now?** YES / NO

---

## üìä MONITORING AFTER LAUNCH

### What to Watch:
1. **Airtable record count** - Should increase as people sign up
2. **Empty services** - Are people avoiding certain dates?
3. **Support questions** - Track what confuses people

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE FOR USERS

If someone reports an issue:

**"I signed up but don't see my name"**
1. Ask them to hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check Airtable - is their signup there?
3. Check the date format in Airtable matches exactly
4. If in Airtable but not showing: DATE MISMATCH BUG

**"I can't click the Sign Up button"**
1. Is the service grayed out? ‚Üí Already filled
2. Are they viewing Q1 2026? ‚Üí That's locked
3. Try refreshing the page

**"It won't accept my email"**
1. Currently NO validation, should accept anything
2. If seeing error: unexpected bug, report to you

**"I made a mistake and need to cancel"**
1. Currently NO cancel feature
2. You need to manually delete from Airtable
3. Then page will update within 5 seconds

---

## üìû SUPPORT PLAN

**If you're launching, be prepared for:**
- Phone calls from less tech-savvy people
- Questions about the password
- "How do I...?" questions
- Bug reports

**Have ready:**
- Phone charged and nearby
- Airtable open to manually fix issues
- Laptop ready to deploy fixes
- This checklist for reference

---

## ‚ú® FINAL THOUGHTS

**The app is 85% ready.** The core functionality works, but there are rough edges:
- No email validation
- No confirmation messages
- No way to cancel/edit
- Caching issues might still exist

**If you need this live TODAY:** Do the soft launch with 2-3 people first.  
**If you can wait 1-2 days:** Let me add email validation and confirmation messages.  
**If you can wait a week:** We can add cancel/edit functionality.

**Most critical test:** Sign up yourself right now, verify it appears in Airtable AND on the page.

---

## üìÖ NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Run through complete test flow yourself
- [ ] Test on your phone
- [ ] Decide: soft launch or full launch?
- [ ] Want me to add email validation + confirmation? (10 min)
- [ ] Set a launch date/time
- [ ] Prepare support plan
